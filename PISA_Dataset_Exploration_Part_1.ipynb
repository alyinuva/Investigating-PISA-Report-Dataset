    "# Data Exploration of PISA report: Relationships Between Student Performance, Socioeconomic Status and Internet Access\n",

    "### Brief introduction to the PISA report\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a good education is one of the most important factors for a person to fully develop their skills, be able to provide a better quality of life for themselves and their families, and contribute to the economic development of their community. This is well known by different governments worldwide, which is why more and more States are investing in knowing the educational level of their population, the results of their educational efforts and how to improve it. One of the reports that help this goal is the PISA report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PISA report, from the acronym Program for International Student Assessment, is an OECD program that measures the performance of 15-year-old students in three competencies of importance for their development in the adult world: reading, mathematics and natural sciences. This program is done every three years and allows the different governments to have comparable data in order to have a better knowledge of the performance of their students and improve their educational policies. The program started in the year 2000, participating 32 countries. Since then, the PISA study has grown to involve 65 economies worldwide for the 2012 report. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of the PISA report is not to test the student's knowledge, but to measure their aptitudes and abilities relevant for an optimal development in the adult world. The study focuses on 15-year-old students as this is the age where compulsory education is commonly completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to the PISA dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will explore the data obtained in the PISA report of 2012. The database, which can be obtained [here](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2012database-downloadabledata.htm), has information on 485490 students of 15 years from 65 countries worldwide. One of the most outstanding points of the PISA report is the amount of information that was collected. Not only basic data such as country, age and score was obtained; but rich and varied data, from quantity of books in the student's house, educational level of their parents, access to Internet, etc."
