## Dataset

In this project, we will explore the data obtained in the PISA report of 2012. The database, which can be obtained [here](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2012database-downloadabledata.htm), has information on 485490 students of 15 years from 65 countries worldwide. One of the most outstanding points of the PISA report is the amount of information that was collected. Not only basic data such as country, age and score was obtained; but rich and varied data, from quantity of books in the student's house, educational level of their parents, access to Internet, etc.
